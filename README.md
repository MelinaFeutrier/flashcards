# Flashcards

## Project Description
The Flashcards application is a fun and interactive platform designed to help learners memorize information through the use of flashcards. Users can create, manage, and play tailored learning sessions to enhance their knowledge efficiently.

## Functional Rules

### Managing Flashcards
**Adding a flashcard:**
- A flashcard includes:
  - A question.
  - 4 possible answers.
  - A correct answer.
  - Tags to categorize the flashcard (e.g., math, history).

### Managing Game Sessions
**Launch a game session for a student:**
- Select a flashcard category.
- Generate a session containing 5 flashcards chosen at random from the selected category.
- The session has no time limit.

**Respond to a list of flashcards:**
- Flashcards are presented one by one.
- Each response is recorded in the session as correct or incorrect.

### Saving Data
The application records:
- The studentâ€™s score.
- The list of answers provided by the student for each session.
- The session status, including:
  - The next question.
  - Whether the session is completed or not.
